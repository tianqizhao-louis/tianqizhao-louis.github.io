[{"content":"Why Brandeis Career While I was working as an office assistant at Brandeis University, I was assigned to collect, clean, and visualize all CS alumni\u0026rsquo;s data, including their majors and their job history (companies and the corresponding employment duration). We spent six months just on collecting all the data and put it into a large Google Sheet file, and then we spent an entire semester on cleaning it.\nWe had a large team and without a clear documentation, different people had different habit of recording the data. It turns out that the python code we wrote only works for one semester, and then when a new group of office assistants steps in, it breaks! They\u0026rsquo;ll need to take a deeper look into the code to figure out how to make the cleaning process work. Plus, Google Sheet is too bad to handle a large amount of data.\nBecause I\u0026rsquo;m taking Introduction to Database and User Interface Design this semester, I think I can probably advance this whole process into a new stage.\nI thus initiate Brandeis Career, a project that will enhance the experience of data collection, data cleaning, and data visualization not only for office assistants, but also for the department, faculty members, and the entire Brandeis CS Community.\nWhat is Brandeis Career Three Interfaces Brandeis Career contains three parts:\na backend MySQL database that is efficient for organizing all the alumni data and scalable for new office assistants to step in and easily Create, Read, Update, and Delete data records if they have prior SQL or python knowledge (pymysql or sqlalchemy). a backend Web GUI that has proper access control for office assistants to visually interact with the database (Create, Read, Update, and Delete). They don\u0026rsquo;t need any programming knowledge when using the Web GUI. It also allows the department staff and faculty members to view the data and perform any high-level operations. a frontend Web GUI that allows any Brandeis student to view the alumni\u0026rsquo;s career trends (bar graph, pie graph\u0026hellip; any data visualization tools) or even reach out to alumni themselves. How Brandeis Career Benefits the Whole Brandeis Community For office assistants, they don\u0026rsquo;t need any prior programming knowledge to interact with the database (of course you will need it if you want to contribute to the project), and their interactions are set to be uniform and consistent from generation to generation, so the next group of OAs won\u0026rsquo;t need to worry about any hereditary matters.\nFor department staff, it will minimize the costs of rebuilding stuff again and again once the whole system is set. The staff can also easily view the whole database and perform any high-level data operations, like data visualizations, if they\u0026rsquo;d like. Like the staff, professors will also be benefited when they are wondering which company a specific student goes to or should they offer a new course based on the career trends.\nFor Brandeis students, besides what\u0026rsquo;s been established by Hiatt Career Center, Brandeis Career is the first attempt to summarize all Brandeis CS students\u0026rsquo; alumni data and try to visualize the trends. If students are wondering which companies they should apply to or which company has a lot of Brandeis alumni, they can take a look at Brandeis Career.\nBehind Brandeis Career Backend MySQL database The alumni database is developed using MySQL. The reason I choose MySQL over other database is relational database is just like the tabular data we interact with daily, and MySQL is a relatively stable service to use.\nBackend Framework I\u0026rsquo;m still deciding between whether to use flask, django, or Node.js to develop the Web GUI. I\u0026rsquo;m currently inclined to choose flask because that\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;m most familiar with, but Node.js might also be a good idea since it\u0026rsquo;s been taught at Brandeis in recent years.\nFrontend Framework There isn\u0026rsquo;t a lot of frontend work involved, so I will probably just go with flask\u0026rsquo;s template system + JQuery. If in the future it emerges to a customer-facing application, I will choose between React.js or Vue.js then.\nDatabase I\u0026rsquo;ve created a Database Schema draft using Crow\u0026rsquo;s Foot Notation.\nIn the graph, PK stands for Primary Key, and FK stands for Foreign Key.\nIt will be constantly updating according to department\u0026rsquo;s needs.\n","permalink":"https://tianqizhao.com/posts/brandeis-career/","summary":"Why Brandeis Career While I was working as an office assistant at Brandeis University, I was assigned to collect, clean, and visualize all CS alumni\u0026rsquo;s data, including their majors and their job history (companies and the corresponding employment duration).

In short, tmux is a terminal multiplexer tool that allows you to run multiple terminal programs in the background. You can detach a session (let\u0026rsquo;s say, vim lab3.c) when you want to leave, and re-attach it at any time.\nThere are so many things behind tmux that will are useful for development, but here I will just go through a very simple case: how to keep your vim process running on CLAC and go and grab a coffee.\nKeep a Session Running in the Background Now, logging in to CLAC by either typing clac (a shortcut that is introduced in listserv) or doing it in the normal way.\n1 clac Let\u0026rsquo;s create a new tmux session by typing:\n1 tmux new Now, you are entering to a new tmux session. Type tmux ls to see all active tmux sessions.\n1 2 test@clac:~$ tmux ls 0: 1 windows (created Thu Dec 2 11:27:27 2021) [28x40] (attached) For now, You can just do all the things that you normally would do in CLAC, such as cd cs3157/labN/partN, vim hello.c, etc.\nWhen you\u0026rsquo;re about to leave, use key binding C-b d.\nC here means Control/ Command.\nYou will now see your terminal has been split into two. The left session is the vim session that you were running, and the right session is a brand new session.\nYou can now safely leave, get a coffee, have a rest, or even close the terminal, and when you come back and would like to restart, type:\n1 2 clac tmux attach You will see that you have retrieved the session you were running before. Good luck on coding!\nWhen you have submitted the lab and want to sleep, just type exit to exit the tmux session.\ntmux will also be useful if you want to split your windows into two, one at the current lab and the other at the previous lab solutions.\nUseful Links If you\u0026rsquo;d like to know more about tmux, here are two links that might be useful:\ntmux Official Document: Getting Started\nA Quick and Easy Guide to tmux\n","permalink":"https://tianqizhao.com/posts/tmux/","summary":"While taking the Advanced Programming class, the thing that bothers me the most is not that we need to program using Vim in CLAC, a remote server, but every time when I leave for a cup of coffee, my laptop sleeps, and CLAC connection is automatically closed, so I have to type clac, cd cs3157/labN/part1, vim xxx.c again and again, which is really annoying.\nJae briefly mentioned a handy tool, called tmux, in listserv, and I found that is useful if you are a coffee person like me.","title":"How to Go and Grab a Coffee while Keeping Your Vim Running on CLAC"},{"content":"Aloha! üëã My name is Tianqi Zhao üòÜ, and I go by Louis.\nI\u0026rsquo;m a junior student at Columbia Universityü¶Å, majoring in Computer Scienceüë®‚Äçüíª.
