      <description>While taking the Advanced Programming class, the thing that bothers me the most is not that we need to program using Vim in CLAC, a remote server, but every time when I leave for a cup of coffee, my laptop sleeps, and CLAC connection is automatically closed, so I have to type clac, cd cs3157/labN/part1, vim xxx.c again and again, which is really annoying.
Jae briefly mentioned a handy tool, called tmux, in listserv, and I found that is useful if you are a coffee person like me.</description>
