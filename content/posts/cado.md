# Problem Statement

For **remote working** parents with children **aged 1-5**, **mothers** struggle to focus on their jobs because they lack a productive and undistracted environment at home.

# Primary Research

## Children

- *"If my kids were doing homework at a certain time, I knew I would need to make time to help them."*
- Need extra time to help children with homework or other chores
- Need something to keep their children busy
- Want their children to feel cared for at home

## Self

- "The only 'me' time I could possibly have is either in early morning or at late night... When I’m working from home, my kid, work, and trifles would keep me spinning and I have no idea which one to prioritize."
    - Want to have focus time for themselves
    - Need to set priorities for their tasks
    - Need to time to reflect and self-prioritization
- *"The challenge for me as a working parent is that there were no concrete lines of nine to five."*
    - Need flexibility when creating a daily routine/schedule
    - Want to feel safe using time off

## Work

- *"Sometimes, I feel like I am not putting in my full effort as an employee and as a mother. It is hard to balance it all, and I have to give up something."*
    - Want to produce quality work for job
    - Want to feel connected to office/team
    - Want to work efficiently

## Environment

- *"I had to coordinate with my husband. There was no way I could simultaneously wear four hats at the same time. I'm an entrepreneur. I'm a wife. I cook and clean the house. I take care of the kids."*
    - Need to know division of labor at home
    - Want food that is easy to prep and cook so do not waste time
    - Want other parent to help out more with household chores


> Seeking an undistracted work-from-home environment, mothers want to focus on their jobs as well as have a balance between taking care of themselves and their children.

| ----------- | :-----------: | ----------- |
| Love courses that teach valuable skills and languages        | Positive         | Instructor-led language courses, simple maths, life skills, team-working skills; napping classes, exercise courses |
| Can prepare kid for technology     | Positive          | User-friendly interface specifically designed for kids |
| Too much screen time     | Negative          | Limit to 20 minutes-ish per class with breaks in-between; Send alerts to parents about screen time |
| Kids get bored     | Negative          | More body-involved classes like yoga, napping, stretching, jigsaw, exercises, etc. (not only academic!) |
| Will need to find a quiet space for the child to sit and "take meetings" as well     | Negative          | Provide the option to bundle the courses with a kid’s headphone which suit the kid and provide the quietness for mothers |

# Critiques

***Will the kids be interested? How would you keep them involved? Wasn’t there a lot of problems of keeping kids engaged through visual platforms during the pandemic?***

- Yes! Kids will remain engaged through the offering of different types of classes in addition to academic, including:
    - Body-involved classes like yoga, dance, & exercise
        - Exercise is a great way to activate the brain and a child's ability to comprehend and memorize. 
    - Life skills classes such as art/shapes, safety, etiquette, & playing chess
- Short class time of about 20-25 minutes with inspirational instructors to accommodate short attention span of 9-18 min of kids age 3-6
- CADO will also be able to provide classes with at-home kits like puzzles and building castles for hands-on activities 
Buddy zone feature encourages co-learning and building of social skills
- During the pandemic, visual platforms for academic education were not the norm for kids, which is why they struggled. The introduction of CADO with its fun courses at such a young age will help kids acclimate to this “new normal” early on and ensure success in school in the future.  

***Would moms be okay with the amount of screen time this involves?***

- **Awareness**: We will alarm parents about how much screen time children are spending on our app, so it’s up to the parent to decide;
- Studies find children from age 2 to 5 are already spending more than two hours a day looking at screens. Based on customer feedback, moms would love to make **these hours more valuable** by taking online classes **instead of just browsing Tiktok/mobile games/Youtube**;
- We provide not only academic content that requires the children to pay attention to the screen, but also napping classes, exercises, puzzles, or building classes that don’t require a lot of screen time;
- According to our customer feedback, moms are mostly okay with children resting between 20 minutes classes rather than always looking at the screen.
