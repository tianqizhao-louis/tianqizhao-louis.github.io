      <description>Story As a pet lover, I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting a Ragdoll for so long. During my search for a cat, I figured out that although there are plenty of websites connecting shelters with petfinders, there isn&amp;rsquo;t a single successful platform connecting breeders with petlovers.
Right now, if you want to find a breeder, you have to go online and search for &amp;ldquo;best Ragdoll breeders in New York City&amp;rdquo;. This will lead you to watch tons of bad-designed websites, send countless emails, do many interviews, pay deposit fees, and finally - you have to wait for six months for the litter.</description>
